# SpringBoot / Spock Demo
A demo application showcasing various uses of SpringBoot, Spock, JPA, and MockMvc.

- This application was built using IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/ 
- It requires the Lombok plugin to be installed into IntelliJ: https://projectlombok.org/setup/intellij
- Ensure that Lombok is functioning by enabling "Enable annotation processing" under Preferences->Build,Execution,Deployment->Compiler->Annotation Processors.
- The project uses Gradle for build and dependency management. You may have to install Gradle first and then open the project in IntelliJ IDEA as a Gradle project. The easiest way to install Gradle (on a Mac) is to install it via Homebrew (https://brew.sh/) via the terminal command ``brew install gradle``.
